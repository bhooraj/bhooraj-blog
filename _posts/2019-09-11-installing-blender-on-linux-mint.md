3. Click on the 'Install' button and copy the command from there.

4. Install 'snapd' using the following command:

      `$ sudo apt install snapd`
        
5. Next, paste the command that we copied from Blender Foundation's official snapcraft page or use the following command:

      `$ sudo snap install blender --classic`

6. Reboot your computer.

7. Blender 2.80 will now be installed and ready to use on Linux Mint.

**Note: These steps will also be applicable for any other Linux distribution which support 'snapd'.**
