The new Raspberry Pi 4 is now out for quite some time. Let’s see what it has got for artists and designers.

# What is a Raspberry Pi?

Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer that is produced by the [Raspberry Pi foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). The Raspberry Pi is aimed at making computing, programming and robotics accessible to users at an affordable price.

Before, Raspberry Pi 4b, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has released many other [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Generations_of_released_models). But, this one is supposed to be their most powerful model. The foundation claims that it can deliver ‘Desktop’ like performance.

# Raspberry Pi 4B specifications
- Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz
- 1GB, 2GB or 4GB LPDDR4-2400 SDRAM (depending on model)
- 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz IEEE 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 5.0, BLE
- Gigabit Ethernet
- 2 USB 3.0 ports; 2 USB 2.0 ports.
- Raspberry Pi standard 40 pin GPIO header (fully backwards compatible with previous boards)
- 2 × micro-HDMI ports (up to 4kp60 supported)
- 2-lane MIPI DSI display port
- 2-lane MIPI CSI camera port
- 4-pole stereo audio and composite video port

- 5V DC via GPIO header (minimum 3A*)
- Power over Ethernet (PoE) enabled (requires separate PoE HAT)
- Operating temperature: 0 – 50 degrees C ambient

# Raspberry pi 4b for Artists and Designers
**We got our 4GB version of Raspberry Pi 4 soon after its release, but we took out time to write this article to make it more relevant for our users.**

- **Use it as a Desktop**: If your needs are to browse the internet and view some references, Raspberry Pi 4b is a suitable choice for you. It is an affordable device that you can plug into any HDMI TV/Monitor through a 'micro-HDMI to HDMI cable'. It is a small factor device with less power consumption. You can carry it in your pocket where ever you go.

    We will also need a keyboard, a mouse, a USB-C power supply and a micro-SD card (to install OS image) to use the Raspberry Pi 4b as a desktop. Please note that all USB-C power supplies are not compatible with Rpi 4b. Prefer a UHS-I, Grade 1, Class 10 micro-SD card for faster speed.

- **Use it as a NAS**: You can install [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) on it and use it to access your files on a local network or through the internet. It can be a great alternative to Dropbox or Google Drive. Maybe we would cover this in another article.

- **Create local development environment for building websites**: We know quite a few designers who like to code their websites themselves. Most of them, use Windows/macOS and they have to install applications like XAMPP, AMPPS, MAMP to do so. Some would create a Linux Virtual machine to simulate the environment.

    Raspberry Pi 4b is a perfect playground to create the development environment. And, it is separate from your regular working OS. Doing so, makes sure you don't mess with your working computer.

- **Block the internet advertisements**: We know there are quite a few browser extensions that do this job for you. But with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) you can block the advertisements throughout a network.


Above are the few of the use cases we found best for artists and designers. Although there are other things you can do with a Rpi 4b (such as to create a [Pi Projector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxQ4GFfPJFo) or Pi Plotter), we haven't tried them yet.
