[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a blog-aware static-site generator. It can tranform plain text into static websites and blogs. It is simple as there are no databases or security patches to take care of. It takes in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and HTML & CSS and outputs ready to deploy static site. You can easily use the 'GitHub Pages' free hosting to host your jekyll website.
